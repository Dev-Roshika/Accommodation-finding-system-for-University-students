# Project Collaboration Guidelines

Welcome to our software project collaboration space! In order to maintain a streamlined and efficient workflow, we have established the following guidelines for creating pull requests:

## Pull Request Process

1. **Work Assignment:** Ensure that you have completed the tasks assigned to you during our group meetings. It's essential that your work aligns with our project goals and objectives.

2. **Branching Strategy:** Create a separate branch in the repository for your work. Name it appropriately, indicating the feature or task you've been working on. For example, `feature/user-authentication` or `bugfix/issue-123`. <br>
   *  **main** -  Default branch <br>
   *  **web-develop** - Working branch ( ex: When collaborators want to create a new branch they can copy this branch for their new branch and start from this.) <br>
   *  **web-username** - Each collaborator's own branch ( example: `web-john` )

3. **Code Quality:** Prioritize code quality by adhering to our coding standards and best practices. Make sure your code is well-documented and thoroughly tested.

4. **Pull Request Creation:** When you are confident that your work is ready for review, create a pull request from your branch to the `web-develop` branch, as discussed in our meetings.

5. **Pull Request Description:** In your pull request, provide a clear and concise description of the changes you've made. Mention any relevant issues or discussions related to the work.

6. **Review and Discussion:** Your team members will review your code and provide feedback. Be open to constructive criticism and collaborate to address any issues or concerns that arise.

7. **Approval:** Once your pull request has received approvals from team members and, it will be eligible for merging into the `web-develop` branch.

8. **Merging:** The project lead or designated merge approver will merge the pull request into the `web-develop` branch.

9. **Deployment:** Periodically, the `web-develop` branch will be deployed to our staging environment for further testing and validation.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, we aim to maintain a high level of collaboration and code quality throughout our project development process. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to your team members or project leads.
